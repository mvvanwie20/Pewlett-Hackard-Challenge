# Pewlett-Hackard-Challenge

## Overview
This project was built to find the number of retiring employees by title and check for their eligibility for mentorship programs.

## Results
- number of retiring by title
there are 90,398 people of different titles retiring.
- retirement status
about 64% of employees are aging towards retirement
- senior employees
senior employees are those that are 10 years younger than reitrees and can enter a mentorship program for onboarding new employees.
- result overview
Since 64% will be looking to retire there will be substantial need for hiring new employees, hopefully the mentorship program will allow this to go easier than before.

## Summary
-How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
90,398 people will need to be replaced. The largest group effected are the engineers both senior and non senior. 

-Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
there are 1549 mentorship employees available, meaning that for the larger amount of places needing to be filled the mentors woud be quite overwhelmed with their load on top of work.
